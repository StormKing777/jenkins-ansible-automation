# Jenkins & Ansible: Automated CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**. I used **Jenkins** to "watch" my code and **Ansible** to automatically send that code to a server whenever I made a change.

* **Languages Used:** Python Scripting, YAML.
* **Environments Used:** Ubuntu Linux, AWS.
* **Technologies Used:** Jenkins, Ansible, Git.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. **Jenkins Setup:** Installed Jenkins and created a "Pipeline" that talks to my GitHub.
2. **The "Playbook":** Wrote an **Ansible Playbook** that tells the server exactly how to set itself up.
3. **Automated Deployment:** Showed that when I "Save" code on my computer, the server updates itself instantly without me clicking anything!
